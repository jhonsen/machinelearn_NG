### This repo contains my notes on Andrew Ng's ML course via COURSERA.

I'm doing each exercise in both [MATLAB](https://github.com/jhonsen/machinelearn_NG/tree/master/Matlab_track) and [Python](https://github.com/jhonsen/machinelearn_NG/tree/master/Python_track)  
A similar, (nicer) Python repo that I found is found [here](https://github.com/jhonsen/Coursera-Machine-Learning)
