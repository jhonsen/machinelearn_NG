### This repo contains my notes on Andrew Ng's ML course via COURSERA.

Each programming exercise is worked out with [MATLAB](https://github.com/jhonsen/machinelearn_NG/tree/master/Matlab_track) and [Python_track](https://github.com/jhonsen/machinelearn_NG/tree/master/Python_track)  

Solutions to these exercises were built from scratch (as instructed by course tutorials) and from external libraries (scikit)
