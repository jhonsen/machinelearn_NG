### This repo contains my notes on Andrew Ng's ML course via COURSERA.

Each course exercise is approached, using [MATLAB_track](https://github.com/jhonsen/machinelearn_NG/tree/master/Matlab_track) and [Python_track](https://github.com/jhonsen/machinelearn_NG/tree/master/Python_track)  
The solutions were obtained from scratch (as guided by the course tutorials) and from external libraries (scikit)
Btw, a similar (nicer) Python repo for the course is accessible [here](https://github.com/jhonsen/Coursera-Machine-Learning)
